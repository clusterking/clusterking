# B to D tau nu q2 distribution


# Output: 

## q2 distribution normalized by total,  integral is one by definition 

## dGq2normtot(epsL,0,0, epsSL, epsT,q2):


##  I set epsR an epsSR to zero  as the observables are only sensitive to linear combinations  L + R

##  columns: epsL, epsSL, epsT, q2, dGq2normtot(epsL,0,0, epsSL, epsT,q2)
